Xftp is a great applicaiton of Xshell for Windows users manipulate files on remote hosts and local host easily with a graphic interface. Here's an alternative option for proud MacOs users as me: FileZella.

To download: https://www.filezilla.cn/download/client (for chinese users) It only takes one step to install.

After you open the software, this is what the top part of the window should look like:
<div style="text-align:center"><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuanyuw/Blog/gh-pages/_posts/20190812_filezella/top.png'></div>
(The black blocks are there to protect my privacy)

Host is ip address or url of your remote host, and other things are very intuitive.
The only problem I've encountered is when I use the default port (21), the connection will fail sometimes (Error message: Connection attempt failed with "ECONNREFUSED - Connection refused by server".)
If that's the case, simply changing port to 22 should work.
