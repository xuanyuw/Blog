The answer is: "duh, using their eyes." Well, it's not wrong, but the true answer is a little bit complicated than that.
The brain is not merely a blob in our head. What many neuroscientists care about is why the brain can do so many amazing things. Therefore, they often need to see how brain cells interact with each other and respond to stimuli, etc.. But those are often not observable through naked eyes (the brains rest in our skulls anyways), so we need to measure them using various technologies.

Here is a summary diagram of some existing recording and visualization techniques that scientists use nowadays, I'll explain what does it mean later.

In this post, I'll briefly introduce fMRI, PET, EEG, MEG, and Single units recording.

### fMRI and PET

When I say the word brain activity image, does the first figure that pop out of your mind look like this?

That's fMRI(Functional magnetic resonance imaging). But why it is called **functional** imaging? Because there are anatomical images, which shows the structure of the tissue, and functional images, which indicate the change in a specific range over time. So the image above is actually a functional image on top of an anatomical image.

When we are "thinking" really hard using one specific region of the brain, the oxygenated blood would be more concentrated there to make sure the brain activity is well supported, and magnetic property of that region changes accordingly. And we call this change blood-oxygen-level-dependent(BOLD) signal.

As fMRI, PET also uses blood flow as an indicator, but it requires a little bit of radioactive indicator in your vein before hand, so the blood flow can be traced down (don't worry, this is nothing like Chernobyl).

These blood-flow based techniques can detect the activity of a large region, but impossible to see the activity of single cells. And since blood flow is an indirect indicator, they are not as instant as the techniques I'm going to talk about below.

### EEG
EEG stands for Electroencephalogram. It is a widely used non-invasive technique to record brain waves. What does non-invasive means? it simply means scientists don't need to shave your head and cut your skull open to conduct the experiment. This is also why EEG is so popular.

I participated in an EEG study once. The procedure was pretty simple: they first put a "fishnet" cap on my head. Something looks like this:
<img src='https://publications.clas.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Lester_101117_1204_large.jpg'  width="450" height="300">

And then they would connect the wires and inject a type of gel into each little circle on the cap (takes a long time). Then Boom, you have it! Your brain waves are on the computer screen. Tbh, I thought this experience was really awesome, except for cleaning the gel from my hair.

Because the voluntary movements are controlled by your brain, your brain wave will look different when you are doing or thinking about different things, including blinking eyes and wondering what's for dinner. All of those changes show up in the EEG data, which means your brain activities get recorded almost instantly. Therefore, in the diagram, EEG is at the very front of the x-axis, in other words, it has a very high time resolution (from several milliseconds to several seconds).

However, because EEG is non-invasive (remember the definition of non-invasive?), it sacrificed a lot of accuracy and important signals. Detecting neural signals from outside of the skull is like figuring out your friend's location by only hearing him/her shouting to you from afar: You can only tell approximately which direction does the sound come from, but it is nearly impossible to decide the exact latitude and longitude of your friend's location. I.e., EEG has a low spatial resolution. In addition, the quality of signals below the cortex (the surface of your brain) is even worse in EEG data.

### MEG

Although MEG(Magnetoencephalography) sounds like EEG's sibling, they are very different from each other. MEG uses the tiny magnetic field that is produced by electrical currents generated by brain activity. Since it still does real-time updates of the magnetic field of electrical currents, MEG takes a few advantages from both EEG and fMRI: it provides excellent time resolution and okay spatial resolution (better than EEG, but not much).
It looks like a sci-fi version of old-fashion hair dryer in the salon:

### Single Units Recording

As we can tell from this very human-language name, single units recording records the activities of single neurons.

As we said before, the skull is notorious for lower the spatial resolution of our signal. What if we want very high spatial resolution? We open the skull! Therefore, in single units recording, we use teeny-tiny electrodes and connect them directly with brain cells.

This is the technique that my lab (well, the lab I work for) uses. We cut the skulls of little ratties open, plant in the electrodes, and leave the connectors outside of the skulls. Every time we recode them, we would hook up the connectors using cables that connect with an amplifier, then we can see the enhanced signal that comes from each electrode. We also have a complicated speaker, so we can literally hear neuron firing when we are doing the recordings. How cool is that!

Fun facts: The firing pattern of a neuron also varies in different regions of the brain. Sometimes we can roughly tell where the electrode is just by looking at the waveforms.

Also, since the relative difference in voltage changes when we move along the neurons, we can also determine which part of the neuron our electrodes at, or whether the electrode is recording a single neuron or is between neurons.

According to the diagram, single unit recording can be very accurate in both time and space. These high-resolution advantages can be beneficial to a lot of applications: BCI(brain-computer interface), treatment for some diseases (like Parkinson's Disease), and scientific researches, etc.

But the down-side is also very obvious: who wants his/her head cut open just for fun? As an invasive technique, the experiments of single units recording are very limited. For now, the main subjects are patients with epilepsy and just did brain surgery. So scientists don't have to (and never should) do Craniotomy (open-skull surgery) on random people.

### TL;DR
